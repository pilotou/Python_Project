1. pebbles
A man comes up to you and suggests you should play his game. The man has a box containing dark and light
pebbles. He will reach into the box and pull out two pebbles. If the pebbles match, he will throw them away and
put a dark pebble back in. If the pebbles do not match, he will discard the dark pebble and return the light pebble.
He makes you an offer: bet some money, and if you guess what the last pebble will be, heâ€™ll double your money.
Should you play the game?
